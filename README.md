<h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
<p>
  This project focuses on predicting house sale prices. Below are the steps taken for data preprocessing:
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Installation of Required Libraries</h3>
<p>
  The initial step involves installing necessary libraries from the <code>requirements.txt</code> file.
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Data Cleaning</h3>
<p>
  The dataset stored in the "DATA" folder as <code>sample_dataset.csv</code> underwent thorough cleaning. Steps included outlier removal, handling duplicate entries, and eliminating unwanted columns.
</p>

<h3>Step 3: Preprocessed Data</h3>
<p>
  Post-cleaning, the preprocessed data was saved as <code>preprocessed_data.csv</code> in the "DATA" folder.
</p>

<h3>Step 4: Data Splitting</h3>
<p>
  The dataset was split into training and testing sets (<code>X_train</code>, <code>y_train</code>, <code>X_test</code>, <code>y_test</code>), which were stored in NumPy data format in the "DATA" folder.
</p>


<h2>Regression Model Training</h2>
<p>
  For regression model training, the following steps were undertaken:
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Regression Models and Metrics</h3>
<p>
  In the <code>Task 2_Regression.ipynb</code> file within the "Code" folder, regression models were implemented, and metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2 Score, and RMSE (Cross-Validation) were evaluated.
